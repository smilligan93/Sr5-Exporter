# Shadowrun 5e Hero Lab VTT Exporter
That's a mouthful.

### How to Use
Download the latest release here: https://github.com/smilligan93/Sr5-Exporter/releases

Launch the file, this will open in it Hero Lab and ask you to install it.
- If updating, it may mention that the folder exists. Generally you want to override this

Once it is installed, open up your shadowrun character in Hero Lab.
- In the **File** menu, go to **Save Custom Output**
- Select Universal VTT
- Click Output

This will open up the file in a web browser. 

Copy the json output and paste it wherever you would provide Chummer output.

Not everything is exported, see the mentions in the file.
If you find a bug (and trust me, they're there) please make a github issue for it.
